# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

This Python algorithm will be classifying handwritten digits ranging from 0-10. There are 2 files in this repository and both files will be using PyTorch framework. One file will be using traditional Neural Network and the other file will be using Convolutional Neural Network. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** often times produce a model that yields more accuracy and can be trained much more quicker than traditional Neural Network.

There are 4 images in this directory, 2 **Loss Against Epoch** graphs and 2 **Accruacy Against Epoch** graphs. You can see that the algorithm with CNN yield a model with **4%** more accuracy than the other. You can play around with the hyperparameters such as **Number of channels, Kernel Size, Stride & Padding** to increase the accuracy and decrease the loss of your model.
